### Intro to Gulp

To clone run:

$ composer create-project dvomedia/gulp-skeleton path/to/install

Composer will create a new Gulp/Silex project under the path/to/install directory.

Assuming you already have the standard dev tools (node, npm & bower, bower) installed, all you need to do is checkout this codebase and then run:

$ ./install.sh

Done.

All bootstrap and fontawesome and anything from resources/sass/style.scss will be included in web/dist/css/style.css.

Jquery 2.1.4 and any other js (resources/js/*.js) will go into web/dist/js/*


### Don't have standard dev tools?

brew install node
gem install sass
